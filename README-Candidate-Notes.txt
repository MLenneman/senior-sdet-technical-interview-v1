Hi, Good morning!
I'm uploading some of the API tests that I was able to do in time.
I had some issues installing the AngularCli and that consumed a lot of time.
I'll be uploading the complete code with complete API and Selenium/UI tests on my GitHub on https://github.com/FernandoSouzaJr 
in case the cert expire before i can finish it.


Any doubts feel free to ping me on LinkedIn chat (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandosouzajr/)


During the cleanup I had some issues with the "app".
It crashes with the log you can find in the root folder of the automation project as txt file and contents of zip file.
In real life scenario i would open a bug with details on how to reproduce and with logs and other evidences attached.

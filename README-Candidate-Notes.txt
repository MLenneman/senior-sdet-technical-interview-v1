Hi, Good morning!
I'm uploading some of the API tests that I was able to do in time.

I had some issues installing the AngularCli and that consumed a lot of time.
Since i was not able to run the ui(my Windows refuses to run the ng serve), 
I added a simple test(Insite360PageTestExample.class) searching insite360 on google and then navigating to careers page using Selenium and PageObjects.


Any doubts feel free to ping me on LinkedIn chat (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandosouzajr/)


During the cleanup on API tests, I had some issues with the "app".
It crashes with the log you can find in the root folder of the automation project as txt file and contents of zip file.
In real life scenario i would open a bug with details on how to reproduce and with logs and other evidences attached.

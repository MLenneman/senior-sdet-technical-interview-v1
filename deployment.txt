For deploying and running the tests on docker use the following command:

 docker build --no-cache -t qascript:latest -f ./Dockerfile .


quick reminder, the tests are pointing to localhost and i didn't added a parameter to inform the endpoint url so they will probably 
fail unless you deploy the mock app to same docker image or change the endpoint in tests to point to correct ip
